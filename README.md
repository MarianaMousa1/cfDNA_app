**Welcome to the dPCR Dashboard**
The purpose of this application is to visualize dPCR data of cfDNA markers in the context of solid organ transplantation. It enables comparison of runs, samples, and experimental conditions in order to select the most optimal setup and to facilitate interpretation of the results.

**Required Data Format**
Please upload an Excel file (.xlsx) containing the following column names:

Run_name
Group
Sample
Total
Conc (use a comma as decimal separator, e.g., 1,23)
Positives
Threshold
%NEG
%POS
Annealing temperature
Primers_Concentration
DNA (must be one of: Homozygous, Heterozygous, Multiplex, NegativeControl)

**Before Uploading**
Ensure that sample names are consistent across runs.
Calculate %POS and %NEG in Excel prior to upload.
Use a comma (,) as decimal separator in the 'Conc' column.
Only .xlsx files with correct headers are accepted.

Use the tabs on the left to navigate through different analysis views.
